Gloze sits at the boundary between the web of documents and the web of data. The mission of Gloze is to enable the free flow of information between the hypertext we know as Web 1.0, and the emerging semantic web of linked data. The goal is to develop tools and knowledge that allow people to explore linked data through documents, and to liberate the content of their documents as linked data.
